    <p>Rice balls, or arancini, are a popular Sicilian snack of leftover cooked rice mixed 
        with other flavorful ingredients (usually meat sauce), breaded, and deep-fried. This
        version is filled with a savory mixture of mushrooms, peas, and onion and then baked
        to crispy perfection. Dip these scrumptious finger foods into a side of tangy 
        marinara sauce to get the full Italian experience. Perfect as a dinner party 
        appetizer or an afternoon snack!  For more healthy meals inspiration,

    </ul>
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Place 
            potatoes in a steamer basket in a large saucepan. Add water to saucepan to 
            just below basket. Bring to boiling. Steam, covered, about 15 minutes or until 
            tender. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl; mash with a fork.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large saucepan combine rice, 1 cup of the marinara sauce, the 
            milk, the ¼ cup nutritional yeast (if using), and 2 of the minced garlic cloves. 
            Bring to boiling; reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, uncovered, 7 to 10 minutes 
            or until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat. Season with salt and black pepper.
             Add the rice mixture to potatoes; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>For filling, in a large skillet cook mushrooms, onion, and the remaining 1 
            clove minced garlic over medium about 10 minutes or until onion is tender, 
            stirring frequently and adding water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, as needed 
            to prevent sticking. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast 
            (if using), 1 tablespoon of the bread crumbs, the peas, basil, thyme, crushed 
            red pepper (if using), and salt to taste. Cook for about 3 minutes or until 
            heated through. Remove from heat. Let stand about 5 minutes or until mixture 
            is cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Place the remaining bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Shape ¼ cup rice mixture 
            into a 2- to 2½ -inch patty, dusting your hands with bread crumbs if the mixture 
            sticks to them. Spoon 1 tablespoon of filling onto center of the patty; fold 
            edges of patty over filling to cover and roll into a ball. Roll each ball in 
            bread crumbs to coat; place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining 
            rice mixture, filling, and bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned. Heat up the remaining 1 cup 
            marinara sauce. Serve with rice balls.</li>
